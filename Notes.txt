# Web Services Services
Web application works using html and http, where as web Services works using http and xml. Where html is only understand by the web browser, xml could be read by any
software applciation and converted into language objects in which that application was written. 
The power of XML comes from its data nad meta-data.

Advantages of web Services
* Platform Independent - This independency comes from HTTP, which is transport independent, and XML which is Data Independent.
* Application Tailoring/Customization 
* Firewall friendly

Disadvantages of web Services
* Ambigious Web Services standards
* Performance impact due to serialization and derialization 

When to use Soap services.
* When a formal contract is required.
* Non functional requirements like -security and Transaction management are required.
* Reliable Asynchronous Processing.

SOAP - Services
Specification from w3c.
WSDL - The contract and much more.Web services description language. It's an xml file. It tells what this service provides and how and how consumer can access it
Based on this the file is devided into two portion. Abstract portion and physical portion. Abstract portion tells what this web serive provides and what is it
composed of. The physical component consist of two items. The binding and service and how consumer can use it. 

Abstraction - types, messages, operation, porttype
Physical - binding, services 

SOAP WS Design 
* Top down or WSDL First or Contract first 
* Code First or Bottom up

* WSDL First or Contract First Approach
    * Create the WSDL file - has all the information about the web service
    * Generate the java stubs using tools like wsdl2java
    * Implement the web services end point

Advantages of WSDL:-
    * Contract with the consumer is signed off
    * Better Interoperability
    * Faster Integration

* Code First Design
    * Write Java code first and annotate
    * Generate the WSDL code from the code using java2wsdl

Advantages of Code first Design:-
    * Legacy application Integration

JAXB stands for java architecture for XML binding. It provides an easy way to map java classes and XML Schema.
Provides three tools:-
    XJC - It can generate java classes from a given XML Schema.
    SCHEMAGEN - It generates a XML schema from a java class.
    RUNTIMEAPI - It converts the java objects into XML. It comprised of Marshall class, UNMarshall class and Annotations.

Marshalling is the process of converting java objects in xml. and unmarshalling is the other wat round.
